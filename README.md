## Summary
This project was made to show some of programs I have made while studying at the bootcamp and some of the techiques that was used to create this webpage. During this project, I utilized HTML and CSS for styling and making the skeleton of the webpage.

## Technology Used
 - HTML : Use to stucture our website
 - CSS : Use to style our website
 - Git : for version control system to track changes to source code
 - GitHub : hosts the repository that can be deployed to GitHub Pages

## Code Snippet
```html

/* add a flex box to the unlorder list */
.nav-list{
    display:flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    column-gap: 2em;
    padding-bottom: 40px;
    margin-bottom: 60px;
}

/* makes the list item style */
.nav-list li{
    display: inline;
    float: left;
    border-bottom: 2px solid black;
    margin:auto 10px auto 10px;
    height: 35px;
    width: auto;
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 180%;
}

```
Above is some of the styling I used to make this webpage. Most of this was making the flexboxes and aligning the boxes correctly with each other.
